# PeerJS
This is a simple chat app that uses [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com) to directly connect two clients over WebRTC.
It does not require a server as the clients are directly connected.
All of the code is commented pretty well explaining what each thing does.

## Running it
To run the example, clone the repository and open the `peerjs` folder.
Then open `index.html` and you will be good to go.
